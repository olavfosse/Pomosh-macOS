## About 🍅 Pomosh

Is it the first time remote working? Or are you tired of distraction at home in these COVID-19 days? Pomosh can help you fight against procrastination and distraction.

### How to:

A working block and a break count as a cycle. A Cycle with a 25-minute working & 5-minute break is a good starting point for newbies. How many cycles do you need in a day? It depends on your workload. It's time hustle. Create a new session and follow working/break cycles while working. Pomosh will help you focus.

### Main Features:

- Timer: Helps you to follow Pomodoro Technique practices. It shows remaining working/break time with remaining cycles in your session. You can start/pause with clicking. The first click on the timer creates a session. You can think session = your typical working day. The timer automatically continues between work/break cycles. You cannot skip a period. But, yes, you can pause the timer. 

- Skip Button: You can skip current round if you failed your task.

- Reload Button: You can restart your round instead of skipping it if you failed your task.

- Settings: Pomosh is flexible. You can easily change the working & break duration. Also, you can set total cycles in a session, which depends on your workload and rhythm. 

- Menubar Countdown: There is no need to click the app every time to check the remaining time. It shows working & break time. The flame icon means it's working time. Coffee cup with a clock says it's break time. Just enjoy your time. If countdown makes you worry a lot, remember that you can disable the menu bar timer at any time. 😌

- Notifications: Pomosh shows notifications when working time & break time ends. Do notifications annoy you? Just turn them off settings pane.

- Sound effects: A chime effect indicates time is up. You can turn off it off course.

- Global hotkeys: You can easily pause/start the timer with Control + Cmd + P

- Written with Swift & SwiftUI
